== README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

This profile was created on Oct25th for the sake of hosting a small hockey blog via a Rails App, so that my brother can update content automatically without having to use WordPress.


Please feel free to use a different markup language if you do not plan to run
<tt>rake doc:app</tt>.
